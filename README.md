# buildAnHtml5Game
This is my attempt to develop a game based on Karl Bunyan's "Build an HTML5 Game: A Developer's Guide with CSS and JavaScript" book.
I have been reading and typing the code to get the basics.
I already came across two major challenges.
First: The JavaScript Modernizr library load function is used for conditional loading which is now deprecated.
Second: jQuery is used throughout.
The challenge I set myself is doing without the two libraries and using plain JavaScript.
And of course developing my version of the game.
Any help will be appreciated.
